### Hello ! &nbsp; :wave:

Glad to see you here. I'm Pat.

:wrench: &nbsp; I'm a mechanical engineer turned data scientist who loves learning something new every day.

:office: &nbsp; My previous working project connects customers who are likely to be interested in our company products with a proper marketing channel via machine learning based recommendation.

:mortar_board: &nbsp; I took my master degree in applied statistics from NIDA, Thailand.
It was a great decision in mylife shipping from engineering field to data. Also, I'm a life-long learner.
 I usually takes an online couse (~ 3 to 4 courses a yearr) to expand my skills. 
 Please feel free to recommend if you have any courses I shouldn't miss.

:seedling: &nbsp; Iâ€™m currently in love with learning `data-engineering`. I think that if we can combine both data science and data engineering together as a one set of skill.
It will help much in growing up your professional career.

Here are some data engineering projects that I have learned recently.
